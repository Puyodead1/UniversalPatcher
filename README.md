# UniversalPatcher
An offline binary patching system

# About
There are 2 applications:
- Patch Generator
  - Create binary diffs between 2 versions using [OctoDiff](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Octodiff), compressed with LZMA
- Patcher
  - Standalone console app that applies the patches
 
This was based on [SimplePatchTool](https://github.com/yasirkula/SimplePatchTool) and another closed source game patcher I came across.


# Future Ideas
  - [ ] Online Patching Option with Launcher
